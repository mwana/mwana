    TRACE MARY <REASON>
    (Reason is optional)
    Where mary is patient's name.  Message goes out to all CBAs asking them to find and talk to Mary.  
    It also asks them to reply with the message, 
    TOLD MARY
    once they have spoken to the patient and asked them to go to the clinic.
    
    After a set period of time a follow up message will go out of from the system to the CBA that replied
    asking them to follow up with Mary and confirm that she did indeed go to the clinic.
    This is done by having the CBA send the following message to the system:
